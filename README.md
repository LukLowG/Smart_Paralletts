# # Parallettes Force Distribution Tracker

This project explores the integration of load cells into DIY parallettes (made from PVC pipes) to measure and visualize force distribution during exercises like handstands. 

 **Goal**: Help users assess their balance and symmetry during training.

 **Why**:
- Improve technique and body awareness
- Prevent injury from asymmetrical loading
- Exercise technical documentation & engineering skills

## Features
- DIY parallettes construction guide
- Load cell integration (4 per parallette)
- Visualizations of weight distribution
